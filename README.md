## User guide

Navigate from the lower left to the upper right. Once you reach the upper right
you win! ðŸŽ‰

Navigate using either the arrow keys, clicking in straight lines or tracing the
route with your finger.

Use `Options` in the nav bar to change the size, or swap to a different maze
generation algorithm.

## Technology

It is a client side application and can be served from the majority of static
web servers.

For drawing it uses SVG for the maze. HTML is used for the page and CSS is used
to style both.

[Rust](./computer/) compiled to web assembly is used to generate the mazes,
generate the SVG paths and handle the user's route.

Typescript compiled to Javascript is used to handle the user's interactions and
draw back the mazes generated by Rust.

3 canvas alternative renderers can be found in the
[rendering playground](https://storage.googleapis.com/maze-playground/rendering-playground.html).
They are a bitmap renderer where Rust generates a bitmap, a WebGL2 renderer and
a WebGPU renderer.
